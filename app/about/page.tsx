              'Machan this is awesome! Why don't we offer this experience to
              others?' We were camping in a vineyard somewhere near a town
              called Suruli in Theni district of Tamilnadu. The conversation we
              had that night was the spark. We had managed to import a camping
              tent through a friend who had gone on an onsite to the US.
              Suddenly our lives changed! We got access to breathtaking
              locations.Thatâ€™s how we had ended up in the vineyard.

                The Journey:
              </h2>
              Biggest concerns for anyone wanting to go camping in India are
              finding safe campsites & clean toilets. And so we set out with the
              sole motto of addressing these painpoints. We shaped & reshaped
              the idea over several camps, worked on infra, safety & got it into
              a workable form.Today as we speak, all camspites listed in
              Exoticamp are privately owned campsites, with clean toilets, basic
              first-aid kit, trained local hosts & back-up cottage / dormitories
              for rough weather contingency.
